      <h1>Hello, I'm Michael Arrington!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a frontend engineer located in Portland, Oregon. I love the left-brain right-brain balance of frontend development: both creating beautiful and usable interfaces and also solving the associated logic and performance challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an excellent communicator and thrive working closely and collaboratively with product owners, visual and UX designers, fellow developers, and business stakeholders to build and improve modern websites. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Most recently at <a href='https://on24.com' target='_blank'>ON24</a>, my core task was migrating the legacy <a href="https://www.on24.com/always-on-engagement-hub" tareget="_blank">Engagement Hub</a> admin interface to modern VueJS 3 from the existing codebase of VueJS 2, Angular, and Polymer, while also creating new components and implementing an updated design language site wide.   
      </p>
      <p>
        At <a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Gap Inc</a>, I built highly flexible and reusable components in React and TypeScript for their Core UI team. I also focused on performance, improving the NodeJS Server Side Rendering of their Micro Frontends by over 20% with a combination of non-blocking rendering, caching and clustering.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at <a href="https://www.revantoptics.com" target="_blank">Revant Optics</a> I resolved dozens of outstanding Accessibility issues (leading to WCAG 2.1 Conformance), optimized media and JavaScript to reduce load times by 35%, and helped build a custom <a href="https://www.revantoptics.com/products/custom-prescription-lenses" target="_blank">Prescription Lens wizard</a> as a Single Page Application in VueJS within the Shopify platform.
      </p>
       
      <p>
        For my next role, I am especially excited to continue to grow my expertise with VueJS and to help improve web accessibility and performance &mdash; all while staying flexible and solving business needs &mdash; and growing both as a developer and a person.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheers!
      </p>
